A project to create tools to support the creation of correct rule bases on top of rdf triple stores.

The project is still in an early stage, but you can [download](http://vzach.de/projects/trie/TrieDebugger.zip) and try an innovative graphical debugger for rules - it works but is limited to RDF files without anonymous nodes and rules without functors or built-ins. Rule cycles will crash it.

Over time the project will grow to include a bit of formal verification, visualization and some automatic debugging support.

The project is created in Java, is build on top of Eclipse and utilizes the Jena framework.

We love to [hear](mailto:trie@vzach.de) from you, in particular if you need debugging/verification tool for rules on top of RDF! Further development of this project will largely depend on whether people need such a thing!
